Android and iOS themes for multi-tier push menus written in JavaScript. 
Potential implementations for PhoneGap applications.

Attribution to http://tympanus.net/codrops/ for providing the majority of
the JavaScript functionality and the boilerplate CSS.

New additions include Android and iOS themed CSS, fonts, and a relocation
of the menu icon for mobile-centric traversal. New slide-out gradients 
have been provided for the aforementioned themes as well to provide for
a more pleasant UI experience.
